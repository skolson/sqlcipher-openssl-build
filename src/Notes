Issues
============================================
Sqlcipher build task should verify presence of built library at end of build. Currently only android builds check.

Apple Builds
Mac Big Sur openssl
    ranlib gets a series of "has no symbols" warnings - ignoring for now.
    build shows two "Cannot find "WWW::Curl::Easy" in podpath" warnings
         Used info at https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2165289-learn-how-to-install-run-curl-on-windows-macosx-linux
         to install curl, which also installed homebrew. Unsure what in openssl build is using this

         su Steve
         ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
         brew install curl

         May not have been necessary - see if warnings persist - they do.
         To force newer curl:
         export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.80.0_1/bin:$PATH
